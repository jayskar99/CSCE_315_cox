    <h1>MS150</h1>
    <p> Every year, for as long as I have been alive, my family volunteers for the MS150. 
        This event is an 150 mile bike race from Houston to Austin to raise money for Multiple 
        Sclerosis. We are in charge of the bike compound at the half way point in La Grange, 
        this is where riders safely keep their bikes overnight. The bike compound is composed 
        of a baseball field where we set up bike racks and signs to designate where to park. 
        Each rider is assigned a rider number which they have on a wristband and a corresponding 
        paper attached to their bike. Our job is to track the inflow and outflow of bikes via 
        their assigned rider numbers. Once the rider's number is entered into our database, we 
        walk them and their bike to the assigned rack according to their number. This is to ensure 
        easy pick up the following day. After the last of the riders enter their bikes at 10PM, we 
        lock up the compound and a local officer guards the only entrance to the field overnight. 
        Waking up bright and early at 5AM, we open the gates and begin to check out bikes ensuring 
        that the rider numbers match and no bikes are being stolen. This checkout process continues 
        until the last riders set out for the day. At that point, we carefully load the remaining 
        bikes onto a truck to be taken to the finish line for anyone who was injured or dropped out 
        of the event. The final step is to break down the bike racks in order to return the field 
        back to a functioning state. This event has been very important in my growth as an individual 
        because it has built a foundation of giving back to my local community. Although my grandma 
        has Multiple Sclerosis, we have always been sure to work hard at this event which raises 
        money to seek a cure.</p>

    <h1>Aggie Camping</h1>
    <p> Through my organization, Aggie Camping, I participate in the A&M tradition of The Big Event. 
        Every year, hundereds of student organizations gather teams which are sent out to differnt 
        houses in our local community. The idea is to give back to the place which are school is 
        allowed to thrive. Whatever the resident needs, we help them to complete. Last year, we helped 
        clean a garden bed and get rid of ant hills at a residence. This is such a great time to 
        remind myself to give back to my local community which allows me to thrive, and I am excited 
        to particiapte every year.
